This project developed an intelligent ticket booking chatbot using IBM Watson Studio to automate reservations for movies, flights, and events. The chatbot leverages Watson Assistant's NLP to understand user queries, process bookings, and provide instant responses. Key features include real-time API integration for availability checks, automated confirmations, and 24/7 customer support. Designed to reduce human workload by 40%, the system achieved 90% intent recognition accuracy during testing. Future enhancements include voice-based booking and multi-language support. This AI solution demonstrates how conversational interfaces can streamline ticket booking while improving efficiency and user experience.
